    <h1> A Little About Me </h1>
    <p>  I'm an Army veteran of 6 years.  I've been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan with a detour to Pakistan.  My main job function in the Army was communications, though I've done almost everything from laying fiber optic cable all the way to setting up satalite comms from basically scratch.  Even though I have spent a great majority of my life in the IT realm of technology, it is truthfully about the least thing I enjoy about tech.  Most notably I really really loath fixing user email problems! </p>

    <p> I have an immense passion for everything film and theater!  I have taken some acting (for the stage and in front of camera) and directing classes, which led to me being in a few student films as well as getting involved with local film competitions such as the Seattle 48hr Film Fest.  Which if you have never participated in I <strong>HIGHLY</strong> encourage it!
